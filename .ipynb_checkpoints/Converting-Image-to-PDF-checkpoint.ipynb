    "### This code contains *two ways* to make a pdf from an image using Python\n",
    "- The **first one** is using a **basic method**(need to specify path) with img2pdf library (you need to pip install img2pdf incase you never installed it before. )\n",
    "   - The image I used is one of the random images in the first case. \n",
    "   - Here, you give the path to your image file and where to save the pdf and the name you want to give it.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- The **second** is making using **Tkinter to make a GUI (Graphical User Interface)**.\n",
    "  - Once you run the code, you'll get the GUI displayed. (we use the similar as above with img2pdf library, but a little better since this makes life a bit easier at the click of a button (Ofcourse the one we created, :trollface:)\n",
    "  - With second one, you don't need to give a path, rather you can click the buttons from GUI\n",
    "  - After that, select your image and click on convert and save, in the directory you want to save.\n",
    "  - Once converted, the path to the pdf is displayed. You can check and verify the same"
